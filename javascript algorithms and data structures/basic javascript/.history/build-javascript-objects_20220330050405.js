Build JavaScript Objects
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

  Here's a sample cat object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails.However, you can also use numbers as properties.You can even omit the quotes for single - word string properties, as follows:
____________________________________________
*/
  var anotherObject = {
    make: "Ford",
    5: "five",
    "model": "focus"
  };

  /*

var myDog = {
  // Only change code below this line
  name: 'Hannibal',
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ['Chuck Norris', 'Mr.T', 'Rocky']

  // Only change code above this line
};
